## Food/Coffee

During our visit, we had the pleasure of sampling the crab linguine, which was generously
coated in a lemon garlic butter sauce. The dish offered a delightful combination
of savory flavors from the crab meat, followed by a tangy kick that pleasantly surprises
the taste buds. Another commendable choice was the beef ragu, featuring tender beef
cooked to perfection and accompanied by a flavorful sauce.

Among the beverages, the standout was undoubtedly the iced sesame latte. It showcased a well-balanced sesame flavor that struck the right chord, neither overpowering nor excessively sweet.

## Aesthetic

The fusion of these colors, along with an abundance of potted plants and wooden furniture, created a visually appealing atmosphere. The overall ambiance was undeniably Instagram-worthy, offering plenty of opportunities to capture and share the café's stylish and nature-inspired elements.
