## Food/Coffee

<CustomImage image="/columbus/img3.png" />

On my visit to the newly revamped Columbus Coffee Co, I had the pleasure of savoring two delightful dishes: the Breakfast Sammie and the Bacon and Potato omelette.

The star of the show was undoubtedly the Breakfast Sammie. Despite its simple appearance, this sandwich packed a punch of flavors that left me pleasantly surprised. Stuffed with a harmonious combination of eggs, ham, and caramelized onions, each bite was an explosion of absolute goodness.

The Bacon and Potato omelette still held its own in terms of taste and quality. The omelette was generously filled with savory bacon and perfectly cooked potatoes, creating a delightful texture and mouthwatering flavor.

We opted for the Matcha Latte and Iced Latte during our visit. The Matcha Latte leaned towards the sweeter side, offering a pleasant and indulgent taste. Overall, both beverages were decent and enjoyable.

## Aesthetic

An earthy color scheme with lots of browns and neutral tones creates a homely, relaxing, and welcoming vibe. Ambience was lovely.

## Location

Great location, conveniently situated just a 5-minute walk from Upper Thomson MRT station. On weekdays, parking is generally decent, although it may become more challenging during weekends. However, a viable option could be to explore parking options in the nearby landed estates.

## Seating

<CustomImage image="/columbus/img4.png" />

Much larger than a typical cafe. There were plenty of seats available with great lighting when we went on weekdays. Tables were comfortable spaced as well.

## Price

Standard cafe price of $6-9 for coffee and around $20 per main dish. Not cheap, but not unexpected as well for cafes nowadays.

## Wifi/Outlets

They offer free wifi and there were many outlets available. Suitable for doing work on weekdays.
