## Food/Coffee

In our quest to explore Keong Saik's culinary offerings, we embarked on a delightful
journey through their assortment of pastries and breakfast set. While the traditional
Asian toast and eggs failed to leave a lasting impression, our taste buds were captivated
by the recently introduced Miso Kouign Amann. This intriguing creation boasted a
subtly sweet caramelized pastry adorned with delicate shreds of nori. With the first
bite, we were greeted by a profound umami essence, accompanied by a delightful blend
of toasty, funky, and salty-sweet richness.

## Aesthetic

The exterior of the Holland Village shop immediately caught my attention with its charming pale baby blue hue. It exuded a sense of tranquility and freshness, inviting me to step inside. As I entered, I was greeted by a clean-cut contemporary cafe ambiance intertwined with nostalgic elements reminiscent of a traditional kopitiam. The interior featured retro-looking floor tiles that added a touch of vintage charm, blending seamlessly with the modern cafe aesthetic. This delightful fusion of past and present created a unique and inviting atmosphere, setting the stage for a memorable cafe cum kopitiam experience.

## Location

Conveniently situated just a 5-minute walk from Holland Village MRT station. Open carpark right beside Raffles Holland V Mall as well as a few lots right along Jalan Merah Saga Rd.

## Seating

Rather small indoor seating area, we were fortunate enough to find seats indoors but others that came later settled for the shaded outdoor seats.

## Price

Pastries were not cheap, ranging from $4-$9, but expected from cafes nowadays. The burgers were really expensive as well. (yes, they serve burgers too)

## Wifi/Outlets

No Wifi and outlets available.
