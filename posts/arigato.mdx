## Food/Coffee

Our dining experience involved sampling the Gyu Sando, which was described as the
establishment's specialty, and also trying out the Tamago Sando. While the Gyu Sando
failed to impress, the Tamago Sando surprised us with its delightful flavors. The
Tamago Sando boasts a filling of egg mayo and diced tamagoyaki, topped with an Ajitsuke
tamago. However, I found the Gyu Sando to be rather tough and dry. Nevertheless,
I'm eager to explore the other sandwich options available at the restaurant. Unfortunately,
I didn't have the opportunity to sample any of the beverages available, but the Dirty
Matcha Latte caught my eye with its appealing presentation.

## Aesthetic

Not only does Hello Arigato boast a chic and elegant fusion of Japanese and Scandinavian decor, but it also effortlessly emanates an intimate vibe reminiscent of stepping into a welcoming living room. The shelves adorned with a delightful assortment of pop culture knick-knacks and coffee-brewing equipment add a distinct personal touch to the ambiance. Moreover, the café is adorned with a plethora of props featuring iconic brands, infusing the entire space with a trendy and fashionable flair.

## Location

Strategically located, Hello Arigato offers the advantage of being a mere 5-minute stroll from Upper Thomson MRT station. However, it's worth noting that finding parking along Upper Thomson Road can be challenging, particularly during weekends when the area tends to experience high levels of traffic.

## Seating

<CustomImage image="/helloarigato/img5.png" />

Medium-sized café that tends to attract a considerable crowd on weekends, so it's advisable to make a reservation in advance to secure a table. During my visit, I arrived at 10:15 am as a walk-in customer and found that there were only 1-2 tables available at that time.

## Price

The Gyu Sando is priced at $26, which may be considered on the higher end, while the Tamago Sando costs $14, which seems more reasonable in comparison. However, considering that the Gyu Sando features wagyu beef, the higher price point makes sense. As for the coffee, with an average range of $6-7, it aligns with the standard pricing found in most cafes.

## Wifi/Outlets
