## Food/Coffee

<CustomImage image="/madu/img4.png" />

During our visit, we had the opportunity to try the Madu Toast, a delightful dish featuring a caramelized, fluffy shokupan bread generously topped with fruits, honey, and Elle&Vire Cream. The combination of flavors provided a harmonious blend of sweetness and creaminess, making it a truly enjoyable treat.

Another item we tried was the mentaiko brioche bun. This savory delight offered a slightly salty and spicy flavor profile, which was beautifully balanced by the sweetness of the brioche. The contrasting tastes created a pleasant culinary experience.

Additionally, we sampled the matcha croissant, which while decent, didn't stand out as particularly extraordinary compared to the other offerings.

## Aesthetic

The shophouse space of September Coffee impresses with its lofty ceilings, creating an open and airy atmosphere.

The rustic and homely resort ambiance is enhanced by the presence of wooden and rattan furniture throughout the café.

One standout element is the singular tree stump coffee table, adding a unique and distinctive touch to the overall decor.

The combination of these design elements creates a welcoming environment that exudes a sense of tranquility and relaxation.
